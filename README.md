# Simple iOS Location App

This repository contains a very simple iOS app that shows the current user's location on a map and outputs the coordinates of said location.

This app was created to test Sauce Lab's RDC location feature where a real device can have a mocked location.

## Installation
TBD

## Testing
Travis runs a very simple test on Appium to confirm that the location feature is working as intended.
This runs on a cronjob weekly.

## Latest version
For all versions see the Releases tab on this repository ([link](https://github.com/enriquegh/SimpleIOSLocationApp/releases))
